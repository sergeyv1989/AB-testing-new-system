# A/B testing for an online store

In this project I will research the effects of adding a new product recommendation system to an online store using an A/B test.

The data is compiled from:
- Data on the users who signed up to the store during the experiment.
- Data on users who participated in experiments, their experiment and their group.
- Events experienced by the test users in the online store in a time period that includes the experiment.
- The marketing events in the year of the experiment.

The end goal is to decide whether to integrate the new product recommendation system into the online store based on the results of the A/B test.

The main steps of the project will be:
- Loading the data.
- Preparing the data for analysis by discovering and treating issues.
- Performing exploratory data analysis.
- Evaluating the results of the A/B test.
- Drawing conclusions based on the EDA stage and the evaluation of the A/B test results.
